Project Overview: Cyphex Penetration Testing Landing Page.
Cyphex is a fictional penetration testing company, and the Cyphex Penetration Testing Landing Page serves as the company's online hub. This landing page is designed to provide a clear and engaging introduction to Cyphex's services and expertise in the field of cybersecurity.

  - The navigation bar provides a menu that allows users to easily navigate to different sections of the landing page. This feature ensures user-friendliness and smooth navigation.

## Landing Page Image/Hero Section:

  - The hero section typically includes an eye-catching image or graphic that represents Cyphex's core message.
  - It features two buttons: a Call to Action (CTA) button that encourages users to contact Cyphex, and a "Learn More" button that directs users to the About Us section. This layout encourages user engagement and exploration.

## Our Clients Section:

  - This section showcases trust and credibility by displaying logos or names of third-party companies that have chosen Cyphex for their penetration testing needs.
  - It helps build confidence in potential clients by highlighting Cyphex's established client base.

  - It informs users about the range of services available, catering to different security needs.

## Testimonial Section:

  - Positive feedback from previous clients encourages potential clients to take action.

## Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Testing:

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

**Validator Testing**
- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Credits
In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
