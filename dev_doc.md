# Development & Design Guide:

## Introduction:

Throughout the early stages of this project's development, I encountered challenges with the recommended CodeAnywhere cloud IDE, including occasional crashes and a disruptive bug that caused saved projects to endlessly boot. As a result of these challenges, I temporarily refrained from making commits to ensure that any code I did write was not lost in these IDE-related issues.

Recognizing the importance of version control, I transitioned to local development using Visual Studio and Git, providing a more stable and efficient development environment. While this transition was essential, it did result in a delay in committing code to the repository.This is the reason for the  high amount of commits within the first day, as I catch up with documenting my progress. The work on the project began on November 18th.

In the subsequent sections of this guide, I will detail the steps taken during the project's development. 

## Starting Point: November 18th

- Started with brainstorming.
- Initially, the idea was a personal portfolio webpage, but due to a lack of JavaScript knowledge, it shifted to a simple company landing page focused on Penetration Testing, a personal interest.
- Research was conducted to understand the content and structure needed, based on other companies in the Penetration Testing industry.
- A basic wireframe was created to outline the initial layout.
- The project's file and folder structure, including index.html, style.css, and README.md, were set up on the same day.

## Project Progress: November 19th

- HTML structure and placeholders for header, navbar, hero, clients, about, services, testimonials, contact form, and footer sections were created.
- Basic headings and "dummy-text" were added to all sections.
- A rudimentary navigation bar was implemented.
- Initial CSS classes were established and linked to the index.html.
- Brainstorming for a company and brand name commenced.
- "Cyphex" emerged as the chosen name due to its association with "Cipher" (communication encryption), its tech-sounding "cyber" aspect, its non generic name and suitability for a "Figurative mark."

## Project Progress: November 20th

- Sought to create a logo for the brand, exploring various fonts until "Quantify v2" was selected.
- Began searching for free mockups and experimenting with logo generators but didn't find a suitable option.
- Purchased and started using Photoshop to design a simple logo.
- Explored stock photos for a hero image and other content but faced challenges due to inconsistencies in colors and styles.
- Resorted to creating content with Midjourney, designing the hero image and subsequently editing it in Photoshop.
- Focused on achieving a strong contrast by making the left 1/3 of the hero image predominantly black to enhance text readability.
- Invested time in learning Photoshop through tutorials and learning essential shortcuts.
- Overall the a process took way longer than initially anticipated.

## Project Progress: November 21st
### Design Refinement and Styling Initiation:

- Refined the logo further using Photoshop.
- Added both the logo and the hero image to the assets images folder.
- Inserted both the logo and hero image in the HTML index.
- Initiated the styling process in the CSS file.
- Added fonts and created general styles for body{} and headings{} which included defining fonts and colors, as well as setting background colors.
- Began styling the header, adjusting the size of the logo and aligning it with the content of the navbar and menu using flex-box. Additionally, added a box-shadow for visual effect.
- Started the process of selecting a color palette, experimenting with different color combinations.
- Explored options for an easier way to change colors, and implemented a global pseudo-CSS :root to facilitate quick color palette changes for the entire site. Declared color variables for improved consistency.

## Project Progress: November 22nd 
### Mobile-First Approach:

- A mobile-first approach was chosen for the design.
- Added a burger icon to the navbar for mobile navigation.
- Implemented a dropdown menu using a checkbox and toggle class in CSS.
- Included social media links and icons in the footer section.
- Added the SVG path for the menu icon directly in the HTML for compatibility with older browsers that lack HTML5 support.
- Adjusted the color of the menu icon to #cccccc.

### First Mentor Session:

- Conducted the first mentor session, discussing the project idea, concept, and wireframe.
- Reviewed project criteria to ensure all requirements were met.
- Discussed IDE problems and Git commit challenges and how to address Version Control issues encountered during development, as described in the introduction.

## Project Progress: November 23rd 
### Wireframe Finalization and Styling Initiatives:

- Following the mentor session, marginal adjustments to the wireframe were made. - Ultimately created a final version using "Justinmind." <p>(However, becoming familiar with this tool took more time than initially anticipated, even though it's straight forward.)

</p>


### CSS Class Development:
- Developed text and logo CSS classes for text sections.
- Redesigned and implemented box shadow effects for the navbar and dropdown menu to enhance the visual presentation.

## Project Progress: November 24th

### Documentation and Development Guide Beginnings:

- Initiated the documentation process by creating the README.md.
- Provided a purpose for the website and outlined its functionalities and sections.
- Set up headings with empty placeholders as reminders for forthcoming sections.
- Began crafting the Development & Design Guide to comprehensively explain the project's development journey, encompassing technical insights, challenges, coding practices, milestones, and key decisions.

## Project Progress: November 25th
**I had big plans to conquer the coding universe, but even programmers need a break. So, I took a day off to recharge. ðŸ’»ðŸ’¤**

## Project Progress: November 26th
### Documentation and Development Guide:

- Completed the Development & Design Guide up to that date.


## Project Progress: November 27th
### Version Control/GitHub:
- Pushed git commits chronologically to GitHub via Git.<p>- (Note: For future projects I'll use VS Code with Git from the beginning to ensure proper Version Control.)
- Introduced a routine of making regular commits and pushing to GitHub when adding functional changes.
